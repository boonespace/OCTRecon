# OCTRecon
Fast reconstruction and analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT)

This project is designed for **OCT signal reconstruction** and currently supports **bin files generated by proprietary devices**. If needed, please **contact me to extend support for additional formats**. The reconstruction algorithm currently uses a **basic Fourier transform**, with potential enhancements or additional algorithms to be introduced as needed.

## Function Description

- Read and process bin format files
- Use Fourier transform to reconstruct the target

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- Armadillo
- FFTW3
